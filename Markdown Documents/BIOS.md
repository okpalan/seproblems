**Enhancing Problem-Solving Approaches for Neurodivergent Individuals**

Neurodivergent individuals, such as those with autism, ADHD, and Asperger's syndrome, face unique challenges in traditional problem-solving frameworks. These approaches often overlook differences in cognitive processing, stress management, multitasking, and organizational skills. As a result, neurodivergent individuals, including myself, experience increased stress, anxiety, and a sense of overwhelm when tackling complex problems. 

Conventional methodologies are not designed to accommodate neurodiverse cognitive styles, making it difficult for us to break down problems into manageable components and engage in collaborative, effective solutions. Without an inclusive, structured environment, neurodivergent individuals may struggle with high-pressure problem-solving tasks, particularly in group settings.

### Problem Statement:

**Developing a Cross-Platform Configuration Tool for System Capability Discovery**

Modern and legacy systems require efficient ways to enable complex features, like hypervisors, without requiring extensive technical knowledge. For non-technical users, accessing and configuring these capabilities can be daunting. The lack of cross-platform tools that interact directly with system BIOS and other components makes it challenging to manage such configurations seamlessly. 

This cross-platform configuration tool aims to bridge the gap between legacy and modern systems, providing users with a way to easily discover and enable system capabilities, such as virtualization features, within the operating system. By simplifying the process, the tool ensures that updates and restarts are managed automatically to enable these configurations, providing a user-friendly solution for complex system management.
