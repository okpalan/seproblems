**Problem Statement: Potential Vulnerability in Cloudflare’s Lava Lamp-Based Random Number Generation**

Cloudflare uses a physical entropy source—a wall of lava lamps—to generate randomness for cryptographic purposes. This system relies on chaotic, unpredictable motion in the lava lamps, captured via cameras, to produce truly random numbers. However, the setup may be susceptible to environmental manipulation or other interference due to the following:

1. **Physical Arrangement of Lava Lamps**: The lamps are arranged in a fixed, grid-like configuration, potentially introducing a systematic bias if environmental factors influence multiple lamps simultaneously.

2. **Environmental Vulnerabilities**: Factors such as controlled lighting, vibrations, or thermal manipulation could theoretically alter the predictable behavior of the lava lamps. For example, an attacker with access to the room might introduce controlled light patterns or subtle vibrations, influencing the lamp movements in a way that introduces bias in the randomness.

3. **Camera and Image Processing Sensitivity**: Since the randomness relies on captured images, tampering with camera angles, exposure settings, or introducing lens filters could modify the input data before processing. This manipulation could, in theory, introduce patterned or predictable behavior in the generated random numbers.

**Objective**: Identify and assess the extent to which environmental or physical manipulation could affect the reliability of Cloudflare's lava lamp entropy source and determine if this poses a measurable risk to its cryptographic security.
