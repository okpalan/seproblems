**Problem Statement: Enhancing Problem-Solving, Code Sharing, and Efficiency in a Blackhat Telegram Group**

As the founder of a blackhat Telegram group, I recognize the need for a structured, inclusive problem-solving framework that promotes fairness, collaboration, and resource sharing. Our group faces challenges in ensuring that tasks, sales, and responsibilities are distributed equitably among members, while also respecting individual autonomy and decision-making. Additionally, we have an opportunity to incentivize group engagement by sharing codebases that are available for sale, enticing others to contribute to and invest in the group’s success. However, the absence of clear guidelines for sharing and selling codebases within the group leads to inefficiencies, missed opportunities for collaboration, and an uneven distribution of work.

The primary issue is the lack of a systematic set of rules that organizes our activities, ensures ethical considerations are respected, and optimizes task and codebase distribution in a manner similar to fair trade. This gap results in fragmented communication, inconsistent problem-solving approaches, and limited sharing of resources, such as codebases, which could otherwise enhance collaboration and incentivize participation. Furthermore, there is no standardized problem statement template to address technical and ethical challenges effectively, particularly when dealing with server takedowns or operational setbacks.

**Objective:**
The goal is to establish a set of 10 systematic rules that promote transparency, fairness, collaboration, and code-sharing in the group. These rules will ensure that tasks and sales are distributed efficiently, while also creating a structured system for sharing and selling codebases to entice others to engage. Codebases for sale will be treated as a shared resource, allowing members to benefit from one another’s expertise and contributions. Members will be encouraged to solve problems collectively, without being forced into activities they are uncomfortable with, and templates for problem statements will be implemented for consistent issue resolution.

By incorporating a framework where codebases for sale are shared to entice contributions and where every member is part of a collaborative problem-solving effort, the initiative will foster a supportive environment. This structure will enhance the group’s efficiency, promote fair sales, and ensure that operations run smoothly, even when challenges arise.
