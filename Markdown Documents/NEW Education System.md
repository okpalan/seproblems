**Title:** Redesigning Education for Neurodivergent Individuals to Foster Personal Problem-Solving and Skill Progression

**Context:**  
As a neurodivergent individual with autism, ADHD, and Asperger's syndrome, I have experienced the limitations of traditional education systems firsthand. Conventional frameworks often prioritize solving external problems over personal challenges. For neurodivergent individuals, this model is particularly overwhelming, as it neglects our unique cognitive processing styles and need for more personalized, structured learning environments. Additionally, many educational institutions push students towards 9-to-5 jobs rather than allowing them to progress in their areas of interest. This is problematic, as people with disabilities—myself included—want to contribute meaningfully to society, but in ways that align with our strengths and personal goals.

**Defining the Problem:**  
The current education system lacks a framework that allows students—especially neurodivergent individuals and those with disabilities—to focus on solving their own problems rather than external ones. This leads to a lack of progress in personal development, increased stress, and a disconnection from their domains of interest. Furthermore, pushing students into predefined career paths, such as 9-to-5 jobs, stifles their ability to work on what matters to them, hindering innovation and self-growth.

**Objective:**  
To develop a new educational framework that prioritizes students’ personal problem-solving and progression in their domains of interest, especially for neurodivergent individuals and people with disabilities. The model should emphasize independent learning, personal autonomy, and real-world application, allowing students to focus on self-development while preparing them to contribute meaningfully to society.

**Components of the Solution:**

1. **Personalized Learning Paths:** Develop individualized learning paths that allow students to identify and solve their own problems, ensuring they engage with material that aligns with their personal interests and challenges.
2. **Inclusive Framework:** Create a neurodivergent-friendly system that provides structured environments, sensory accommodations, and flexible deadlines to foster an effective learning atmosphere.
3. **Autonomous Skill Progression:** Encourage students to focus on personal skills and projects rather than being pushed towards predetermined job roles, enabling them to contribute their unique strengths to society.
4. **Balance Collaboration and Individual Focus:** Develop a hybrid model that allows for both team-based problem-solving and individual growth, ensuring students still collaborate without losing sight of their personal goals.

**Outcome:**  
This educational redesign aims to give neurodivergent individuals and people with disabilities the opportunity to solve their own problems, grow in their fields of interest, and develop skills that matter to them. By doing so, students can experience reduced stress and increased motivation, leading to more innovative contributions in both personal and professional domains.
