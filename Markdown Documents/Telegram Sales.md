1. **Telegram Bots:** Create or use a Telegram bot that handles sales transactions. The bot can automate tasks like:
   
   - Listing available codebases for sale
   - Accepting payments via crypto wallets or other anonymous payment methods
   - Delivering code automatically once payment is received
   - Managing sales records and inventory of what’s being sold

2. **Smart Contracts (Crypto-based Sales):** You can implement smart contracts on platforms like Ethereum or Solana. When someone buys a codebase, the contract automatically verifies the transaction and releases the product once payment is confirmed.

3. **Automated Announcements & Listings:** Set up a system to periodically post available codebases and sales offers in the group using scheduling tools or bots. This keeps the group aware of what’s up for sale without manual effort.

4. **Payment Gateways:** Integrate with crypto payment gateways that can handle the sales transaction, automating the transfer of funds and the release of the code once payment is verified.

5. **Sales Tracking & Analytics:** Use tools like Google Sheets or a simple database that the bot can update to track sales, identify popular products, and monitor engagement.
